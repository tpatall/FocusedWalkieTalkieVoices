# [WIP] Focused Walkie-Talkie Voices
Lowers the volume of other players that are not talking through a walkie-talkie while you are listening to someone through a walkie-talkie.

For now this mod is still being tested. If you can test it and/or want to give feedback, you can find the relevant thread in the Lethal Company modding discord: https://discord.com/invite/lcmod

Thread: "Muffle nearby sounds (mainly other players) when using a Walkie-Talkie"

## Config Settings
Using LethalConfig you can change the value (0.0 to 1.0 multiplier of normal volume) anytime while in-game. 

You can also find the setting in the config file: `dummy.FocusedWalkieTalkieVoices.cfg`

- **Volume Multiplier** (default = 0.2)
	- How loud other players are compared to players talking through your walkie-talkie. From 0.0 to 1.0.

## Credits
Thanks for the preconfigured BepInEx and LethalConfig (see dependencies)!
